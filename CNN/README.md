# Image classification using Convolutional Neural Network
**cnn.py** contains python code to build a CNN model that classifies images of dogs and cats using convolutional neural network trained on a dataset.

The dataset containing test set and training set of images of dogs and cats can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/chetankv/dogs-cats-images/downloads/dogs-cats-images.zip/1).
